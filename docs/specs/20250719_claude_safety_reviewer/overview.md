# Claude Code SDK Safety and Reviewer System - Overview

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines a comprehensive safety and control system for the Claude Code SDK integration within the pipeline_ex framework. The system introduces a multi-layered reviewer architecture designed to monitor, validate, and intervene in Claude's actions to prevent unexpected behaviors and maintain system stability.

## Problem Statement

When integrating Claude Code SDK into automated pipelines, several risks emerge:

1. **Unbounded Exploration**: Claude may explore beyond intended scope
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: Excessive file operations or computational resources
3. **Repetitive Failures**: Getting stuck in error loops without recovery
4. **Side Effects**: Unintended modifications to critical files
5. **Goal Drift**: Deviating from the original task objectives

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Step Reviewer**: Validates every Claude action in real-time
2. **Pattern Detector**: Identifies off-rails behavior patterns
3. **Intervention Controller**: Provides corrective actions
4. **Recovery Manager**: Handles graceful recovery from failures
5. **Audit Logger**: Comprehensive tracking of all actions

### Design Principles

- **Non-Intrusive**: Minimal impact on Claude's effectiveness
- **Real-Time**: Immediate detection and response
- **Graduated Response**: From gentle guidance to hard stops
- **Learning System**: Improves over time based on patterns
- **Configurable**: Adjustable risk thresholds per use case

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Layer Review System
- Pre-execution validation
- Step-by-step monitoring
- Post-execution verification

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Repetitive error detection
- Scope expansion monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Goal alignment checking

### 3. Intervention Strategies
- Soft corrections via prompt injection
- Hard stops for critical violations
- Automatic rollback capabilities
- Context reinforcement

### 4. Recovery Mechanisms
- Checkpoint and restore
- Alternative path suggestions
- Diagnostic assistance
- Graceful degradation

## Integration Points

### With Existing Pipeline System
- Extends `Pipeline.Safety.SafetyManager`
- Integrates with `Pipeline.Providers.ClaudeProvider`
- Leverages existing checkpoint system
- Uses current resource monitoring

### With Claude Code SDK
- Intercepts at process execution level
- Monitors stdout/stderr streams
- Injects control messages
- Manages working directory scope

## Success Metrics

1. **Safety Metrics**
   - Prevented incidents per 1000 executions
   - Resource overrun prevention rate
   - Recovery success rate

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Review overhead < 5% execution time
   - False positive rate < 1%
   - Intervention effectiveness > 90%

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Transparent operation
   - Clear intervention explanations
   - Minimal workflow disruption

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Core reviewer architecture
- Basic pattern detection
- Logging infrastructure

### Phase 2: Intervention (Week 3-4)
- Soft correction system
- Hard stop mechanisms
- Recovery protocols

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Week 5-6)
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Learning system
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Production (Week 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation
- Deployment guides

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Over-restriction**: Configurable thresholds and bypass mechanisms
- **Performance Impact**: Asynchronous review processing
- **Complex Integration**: Modular design with clear interfaces

### Operational Risks
- **False Positives**: Extensive testing and tuning
- **Maintenance Burden**: Self-documenting and observable system
- **Version Compatibility**: Abstract interface design

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve overall design
2. Begin implementation of core components
3. Establish testing framework
4. Create operational runbooks
