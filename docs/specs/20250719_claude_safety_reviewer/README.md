## Quick Start

### For Developers

1. Read the [Overview](./overview.md) to understand the system goals
2. Review the [Architecture](./architecture.md) for technical design
3. Follow the [Implementation Guide](./implementation_guide.md) to build

### For System Administrators

1. Check the configuration sections in each document
2. Review monitoring and metrics capabilities
3. Understand intervention and recovery options

### For Users

1. Understand intervention messages you might see
2. Know recovery options available
3. Learn how to provide guidance when requested

## Key Concepts

### Safety Layers

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Pre-Execution   │ → Validates actions before execution
├─────────────────┤
│ Real-Time       │ → Monitors during execution
├─────────────────┤
│ Post-Execution  │ → Verifies outcomes
└─────────────────┘
```

### Intervention Progression

1. **Soft Correction** - Gentle guidance via prompts
2. **Context Reinforcement** - Remind of goals and constraints
3. **Resource Throttling** - Apply limits to prevent overuse
4. **Checkpoint Rollback** - Restore to known good state
5. **Emergency Stop** - Halt execution for critical issues

### Pattern Categories

- **Behavioral** - Repetitive errors, wandering exploration
- **Resource** - Memory spirals, excessive operations
- **Scope** - Working outside boundaries, goal drift
- **Quality** - Hallucinations, incorrect assumptions

## Configuration Example

```yaml
safety:
  reviewer:
    enabled: true
    risk_threshold: 0.7
    
  patterns:
    enabled_patterns: [all]
    sensitivity: medium
    
  interventions:
    soft_correction: true
    hard_stop: true
    auto_rollback: false
    
  recovery:
    automatic: true
    checkpoint_interval: 60
    max_recovery_attempts: 3
```

## Integration with Pipeline

```elixir
# In your pipeline definition
steps:
  - type: claude_code
    config:
      prompt: "Implement feature X"
      safety:
        enabled: true
        reviewer:
          risk_threshold: 0.6
        patterns:
          enabled_patterns:
            - repetitive_errors
            - scope_creep
            - resource_spiral
```

## Metrics and Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive metrics:

- Review decisions and timing
- Pattern detection rates
- Intervention effectiveness
- Recovery success rates
- Resource usage trends

## Contributing

When extending the system:

1. Follow the established patterns
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Consider performance impact
5. Maintain backwards compatibility

## Support

For questions or issues:
- Review troubleshooting sections in documents
- Check implementation examples
- Consult monitoring dashboards
- Engage with the development team
