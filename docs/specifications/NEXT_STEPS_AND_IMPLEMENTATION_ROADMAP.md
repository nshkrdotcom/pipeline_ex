# Next Steps and Implementation Roadmap - Mind Dump

## Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)

### Critical Path Items
- **Schema Validation Crisis**: We have NO formal schema validation! This is a ticking time bomb. Need to implement Exdantic-based validation ASAP before someone ships a broken pipeline to production
- **JSON-First Architecture**: The YAML/JSON conversion is foundational - without it, LLM integration is a pipe dream. Build the conversion layer NOW
- **State Management Overhaul**: Current map-based state is a mess. Need structured state with Exdantic schemas yesterday
- **Version the YAML Format**: We're on v2 but have no migration path from v1. What happens when we need v3?

### Quick Wins
- Add JSON Schema generation to all existing pipelines
- Create a simple pipeline validator CLI tool
- Document the ACTUAL v2 features that are implemented (not the wishlist)
- Set up basic monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Create a pipeline template generator

## Technical Debt Bomb (Week 3-4)

### The Scary Stuff Nobody Wants to Touch
- **Executor.ex is a Monster**: 1000+ lines of spaghetti. Needs complete refactor into smaller, testable modules
- **No Integration Tests**: We're flying blind. Need end-to-end pipeline tests NOW
- **Provider Lock-in**: Everything assumes Claude/Gemini. Need provider abstraction layer
- **Memory Leaks**: Large pipelines eat RAM for breakfast. Need streaming/chunking strategy
- **Error Handling**: Currently "let it crash" - need proper error boundaries and recovery

### Architecture Bombs
- **Circular Dependencies**: The component system allows cycles. This WILL bite us
- **No Resource Limits**: Pipelines can consume infinite resources. Need quotas/limits
- **Security Holes**: No input sanitization, no rate limiting, no audit logs
- **Performance**: No caching, no optimization, everything is synchronous

## The LangGraph Parity Sprint (Week 5-8)

### Must-Have Features
1. **Programmatic API**: 
   ```elixir
   graph = Pipeline.Graph.new()
   |> Pipeline.Graph.add_node("analyzer", &analyze/2)
   |> Pipeline.Graph.add_edge("analyzer", "reporter")
   |> Pipeline.Graph.compile()
   ```

2. **State Channels**: Like LangGraph's state updates
3. **Streaming Execution**: Return state after each node
4. **Checkpointing**: Save/resume pipeline execution
5. **Time Travel Debugging**: Replay pipeline execution

### Nice-to-Have Features
- Visual pipeline builder (Phoenix LiveView?)
- Pipeline marketplace
- Automatic optimization
- Cost prediction before execution

## The Real Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

   - State versioning and migration
   - Immutable state updates
   - State persistence interface

2. **Validation Framework**
   - JSON Schema for pipeline YAML
   - Runtime validation with Exdantic
   - Compile-time validation
   - Error reporting with line numbers

3. **JSON/YAML Conversion**
   - Bidirectional converter
   - Preserve comments and formatting
   - Schema-aware conversion
   - Streaming support for large files

4. **Core Refactoring**
   - Break up Executor.ex
   - Extract Pipeline.Graph module
   - Create Pipeline.Runtime
   - Implement proper supervision tree

### Phase 2: LangGraph Features (Weeks 5-8)
1. **Graph API**
   - Node/Edge abstractions
   - Graph compilation
   - Execution engine
   - State management

2. **Provider Abstraction**
   - Behaviour for AI providers
   - Provider registry
   - Dynamic provider loading
   - Fallback strategies

3. **Streaming & Observability**
   - State streaming
   - Execution tracing
   - Performance metrics
   - Cost tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
1. **Component Library**
   - Implement all specified components
   - Component testing framework
   - Component registry
   - Version management

2. **Pipeline Composition**
   - Inheritance system
   - Dynamic assembly
   - Template engine
   - Composition validation

3. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Custom dashboards
   - Alerting system
   - Cost optimization

## The Uncomfortable Truths

### What Will Break
- **Backward Compatibility**: Moving to JSON-first WILL break existing pipelines
- **Performance**: Adding validation and monitoring WILL slow things down initially
- **Complexity**: The system is becoming too complex for one person to understand
- **Dependencies**: We're adding too many external dependencies

### What We're Not Admitting
- The v2 YAML format is overengineered
- Nobody actually needs 90% of these features
- We're building a framework when people want a library
- The LLM costs will be astronomical at scale
- We have no idea how to handle async execution properly

### Technical Debt We're Creating
- Every new feature adds 2x maintenance burden
- The test suite is already falling behind
- Documentation is out of sync with reality
- No performance benchmarks exist
- Security is an afterthought

## The Real Priorities

### What Actually Matters
1. **Reliability**: Pipelines should NEVER fail silently
2. **Debuggability**: When they fail, finding why should be easy
3. **Performance**: Should handle 1000s of pipelines/second
4. **Cost Control**: Prevent runaway LLM costs
5. **Developer Experience**: Should be a joy to use, not a chore

### What We Should Drop
- Complex composition patterns (YAGNI)
- Multi-provider optimization (pick one and do it well)
- Visual pipeline builder (nice but not critical)
- Advanced monitoring features (start simple)

## Implementation Gotchas

### The Hidden Complexities
- **State Serialization**: How do we handle functions in state?
- **Distributed Execution**: Current design assumes single-node
- **Pipeline Versioning**: How do we run v1 and v2 pipelines together?
- **Resource Cleanup**: Who cleans up after failed pipelines?
- **Dependency Hell**: Component versions will conflict

### The Missing Pieces
- **Testing Strategy**: How do we test LLM-based pipelines?
- **Deployment Story**: How do pipelines get to production?
- **Multi-tenancy**: How do we isolate customer pipelines?
- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX - we handle none of it
- **Disaster Recovery**: What happens when the database dies?

## The 90-Day Plan

### Month 1: Stop the Bleeding

- Role-based access control
- Audit logging everything
- PII detection and masking

### Developer Experience Goals
- 5-minute quickstart
- Intuitive error messages
- Comprehensive examples

- Usage-based pricing?
- Hosted vs self-hosted?
- Support tiers?
- Partner ecosystem?

## The Brutal Truth

We're building a Ferrari when most people need a Honda. The specification documents are beautiful but disconnected from reality. The current implementation is 20% of what's specified. We need to either:

1. **Dramatically simplify** and ship something useful
2. **Get serious funding** and hire a team
3. **Pick a niche** and dominate it
4. **Open source it** and let the community help

The current trajectory leads to a half-built monument to overengineering. Time to make hard choices.

## Final Thoughts

This system could be revolutionary OR it could be another abandoned GitHub project. The difference is in the execution. We have 90 days to prove this is worth building. After that, either double down or move on.

The specs are written. The vision is clear. Now comes the hard part: making it real.

Stop planning. Start building. Ship something people can use.

The clock is ticking.
