## Quick Start

### For Executives

Read **Section 1 (Executive Summary)** of `01_enterprise_feasibility_assessment.md` for:
- Overall feasibility rating (8.5/10)
- Timeline estimates (3-4.5 months)
- Resource requirements
- Go/No-Go decision criteria

### For Architects

Review all three documents in order:
1. Start with `01_enterprise_feasibility_assessment.md` for strategic context
2. Deep dive into `02_integration_architecture_design.md` for technical architecture
3. Study `03_eval_pipeline_specification.md` for evaluation framework details

### For Developers

Focus on implementation details:
- **Architecture:** Section 2-5 of `02_integration_architecture_design.md`
- **Eval Framework:** Sections 3-6 of `03_eval_pipeline_specification.md`
- **Snakepit Integration:** Section 3 of `02_integration_architecture_design.md`
- **Implementation Roadmap:** Section 9 of `03_eval_pipeline_specification.md`

## Key Recommendations

### 1. Proceed with Implementation ‚úÖ

The system has strong fundamentals and clear path to enterprise readiness:
- Solid OTP architecture
- Existing checkpoint/recovery mechanisms
- Clean API and extensibility
- Active development with good test coverage

### 2. Prioritize Evaluation Framework üéØ

Most critical gap for enterprise AI deployments:
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
- **Resources:** 1-2 Elixir engineers
- **Impact:** Enables automated testing, regression detection, A/B testing

### 3. Use Snakepit Strategically üêç

Only for Python-specific capabilities:
- ‚úÖ **Use for:** BLEU, ROUGE, embedding models, pre-trained transformers
- ‚ùå **Don't use for:** Simple text processing, data transformation, orchestration
- **Resource:** 512MB RAM per worker, 5 workers per node

### 4. Invest in Observability üìä

Essential for production operations:
- Prometheus metrics exporter
- Structured JSON logging
- OpenTelemetry traces (optional)
- Grafana dashboards

### 5. Plan for Distribution üåê

Design for multi-node from start:
- Use libcluster for node discovery
- Implement distributed checkpoints (S3 + ETS)
- Test cluster failure scenarios

### ‚ùå NO-GO - Consider Alternatives IF:

1. **Python-Only Team** - No Elixir resources (use LangChain)
2. **Massive Scale** - Need 1000+ pipelines (use Kubernetes-native)
3. **Immediate Deployment** - Need production in < 1 month
4. **Single Provider** - Locked into one LLM provider
5. **No Elixir Investment** - Cannot hire/train developers
