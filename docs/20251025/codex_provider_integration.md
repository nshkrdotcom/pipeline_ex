- Design emphasizes modular provider abstraction, deterministic testing, and seamless configuration to maintain compatibility with current workflows.
- Integration aligns with strategic goals for multi-agent orchestration, allowing users to route tasks to Claude, Gemini, or Codex based on capabilities and SLAs.
- Architecture reuses the provider behaviour contracts while expanding step execution semantics to support Codex-specific features such as threaded conversations, approval hooks, and streaming event handling.
- Delivery roadmap targets phased rollout with feature flags, ensuring existing pipelines remain stable while new functionality is validated under live traffic.
- Observability, security, and compliance considerations mirror the rigorous standards applied to other providers, with additional controls for CLI-based execution and sandbox policies.
- The document prescribes migration patterns, testing strategies, and developer ergonomics to minimize friction for contributors and downstream adopters.

## 2. Objectives and Success Metrics
- Deliver a Codex provider module that adheres to `Pipeline.Providers.AIProvider` expectations and supports structured responses, cost tracking, and error propagation.
- Implement a `Pipeline.Step.Codex` executor with parity to existing step modules, enabling pipeline authors to declare `type: codex` steps and configure Codex-specific options.
- Ensure configuration surfaces environment variables (`CODEX_PATH`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `CODEX_MODEL`) and application overrides for consistent deployments across development, staging, and production.
- Provide deterministic mocks and fixtures enabling the test suite to validate pipeline behaviour without external dependencies or CLI invocation.
- Achieve comprehensive documentation covering architecture, configuration, runbooks, and migration guidance to support onboarding and maintenance.
- Maintain or improve pipeline execution reliability benchmarks, including P95 step execution times, failure rates, and checkpoint recovery outcomes.
- Deliver instrumentation aligning with OpenTelemetry conventions, enabling cross-provider tracing, usage analytics, and anomaly detection.
- Provide a rollout plan with feature flag strategy, validation checkpoints, and fallback mechanisms to revert to Claude or Gemini providers if Codex encounters regressions.

## 3. Non-Goals and Out-of-Scope Topics
- Codex provider integration does not attempt to implement MCP server functionality or new toolchain protocols beyond existing pipeline abstractions.
- The design excludes hosting or packaging the `codex` CLI binary; users must install and manage the executable externally according to SDK guidance.
- User interface enhancements (CLI dashboards, web consoles) are out of scope; focus remains on library-level integration and developer tooling updates.
- No changes to billing or token accounting pipelines are proposed beyond reporting Codex usage metrics captured during execution.
- Model-specific prompt templates or fine-tuning flows for Codex are deferred; the pipeline will accept pass-through prompts authored by workflow designers.
- This design does not cover dedicated GPU orchestration or runtime sandboxing beyond existing workspace isolation and CLI invocation safety checks.
- Alignment with future provider-agnostic DSL enhancements is noted but not implemented; contributions should track ongoing RFCs for step schema evolution.
- Support for Codex-specific plugin marketplaces or community-sourced tools is out of scope for this iteration, though the architecture leaves extension points.

## 4. Stakeholders and Review Cadence
- Product Owner: Oversees prioritization, ensures alignment with strategic goals, and coordinates cross-team collaboration.
- Engineering Lead: Accountable for architectural decisions, code reviews, and rollout safety mitigations.
- Reliability Engineering: Validates observability coverage, SLO adherence, and incident response readiness.
- Security: Evaluates CLI invocation, credential propagation, and workspace isolation policies.
- Quality Assurance: Designs regression suites, test matrices, and failure injection scenarios.

- Stakeholder Reviews: Weekly design checkpoints until approval, then bi-weekly progress reviews during implementation, culminating in a launch readiness review.
- Feedback Loop: Comments tracked via issue board, with responses documented in the decision log.

## 5. Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations
- AI Provider: A module implementing the `Pipeline.Providers.AIProvider` behaviour for executing prompts against an external model.
- Codex CLI: The executable shipped by OpenAI that interfaces with the Codex agent runtime, required by `codex_sdk` for process orchestration.
- Thread: A persistent Codex conversation context managed by `Codex.start_thread/2` and `Codex.Thread.run/3` APIs.
- Turn: A single invocation cycle within a Codex thread, producing a set of events and final response payloads.
- Approval Hook: Callback mechanism allowing manual or automated review of Codex tool invocation or environment-sensitive actions.
- Workspace: Filesystem sandbox directory where pipeline steps read and write artifacts, isolated per run.
- Step Executor: Module responsible for executing a workflow step type (e.g., `Pipeline.Step.Codex`).
- Provider Options: Map or keyword list of configuration parameters forwarded to provider modules, controlling model selection, prompt options, and runtime behaviour.
- Telemetry Span: Trace segment emitted via OpenTelemetry describing a unit of work (e.g., provider query, CLI process lifecycle).
- Feature Flag: Configuration toggle gating runtime activation of Codex integration, enabling staged rollout and controlled experiments.

## 6. Background and Current State Assessment
- PipelineEx currently supports Claude and Gemini providers, each with dedicated modules, mocks, and step executors aligned with workflow schema definitions.
- Provider selection is primarily handled through test mode logic; `Pipeline.TestMode.provider_for/1` resolves to live or mock implementations.
- Pipeline step schema enumerates specific types (`claude`, `gemini`, etc.), while `Pipeline.Executor` dispatches to step modules using pattern matching on the `type` field.
- Configuration utilities in `Pipeline.Config` provide provider-specific environment resolution, though Codex-specific settings are absent.
- Observability relies on Logger instrumentation, `Pipeline.Monitoring.Performance`, and provider-level telemetry when available.
- Test suites leverage mock modules under `Pipeline.Test.Mocks` to simulate provider responses and function calling results without external services.
- Current limitations include hard-coded provider routing, partial coverage for multi-provider interplay, and lack of CLI-based provider integration strategies.
- The absence of Codex limits agent diversity and prevents adoption of Codex-specific workflows already documented in related projects.

## 7. Target Capabilities and Future State Requirements
- Ability to declare `type: codex` steps in YAML workflows, specifying Codex options including model selection, sandbox policies, and approval hooks.
- Support for streaming event handling, enabling pipeline steps to process Codex events when required, while preserving compatibility with synchronous response consumption.
- Configurable CLI path discovery logic, respecting overrides and environment variables to accommodate varied deployment environments.
- Telemetry integration capturing process lifecycle events, token usage, approval outcomes, and CLI exit codes for diagnostics and cost tracking.
- Mock implementations delivering deterministic responses, event sequences, and approval flows for testing pipelines without invoking the Codex CLI.
- Fallback mechanisms enabling pipeline authors to define alternate providers or short-circuit execution if Codex is unavailable or misconfigured.
- Documentation, examples, and migration guides ensuring contributors understand how to adopt Codex steps, manage configuration, and interpret telemetry.
- Observability dashboards and alerting extensions to monitor Codex usage, detect anomalies, and provide actionable insights during rollout.

## 8. Architectural Overview
- The Codex provider module will reside under `lib/pipeline/providers/codex_provider.ex` and implement the AI provider behaviour for consistent interface expectations.
- `Pipeline.Step.Codex` will orchestrate prompt construction, provider invocation, result processing, and response normalization to align with pipeline expectations.
- `Pipeline.Executor` will gain new pattern matching branch for `"codex"` type, integrating seamlessly with existing execution flow, checkpoints, and logging.
- Configuration flows extend `Pipeline.Config` to supply Codex-specific settings, allowing fallback to defaults when environment variables are not set.
- Test mode module will route `:codex` provider requests to mocks during unit tests, enabling consistent isolation from external dependencies.
- Observability extends existing telemetry pipeline, with spans capturing CLI spawn, streaming events, approval decisions, and final response serialization.
- A feature flag mechanism (application env or runtime config) will guard Codex activation, enabling incremental rollout and A/B validation.
- Diagrammatic representation outlines interactions among pipeline executor, codex provider, CLI process, telemetry, and storage surfaces.

## 9. Module and Component Responsibilities
- `Pipeline.Providers.CodexProvider`: Encapsulates Codex SDK interactions, handles CLI process management, streaming event aggregation, error translation, and response normalization.
- `Pipeline.Step.Codex`: Consumes workflow configuration, builds prompts via `Pipeline.PromptBuilder`, invokes provider, and updates execution context with outputs.
- `Pipeline.Test.Mocks.CodexProvider`: Supplies deterministic responses for pipeline tests, including scripted event sequences and approval outcomes.
- `Pipeline.Config`: Offers `get_provider_config(:codex)` returning CLI path, model defaults, environment overrides, and timeout settings.
- `Pipeline.TestMode`: Resolves Codex providers for mock/live/mixed modes, enabling dynamic selection consistent with other providers.
- `Pipeline.Executor`: Integrates Codex step type handling, ensuring checkpointing, error management, and logging remain consistent.
- `Pipeline.Streaming`: May require optional adapters to forward Codex streaming events to clients consuming live streams during pipeline execution.
- `Mix` tasks or scripts (if required) to validate CLI availability, check configuration, and provide quickstart experiences for developers.

## 10. Provider Lifecycle and Control Flow
- Step execution constructs prompt and options, then delegates to `CodexProvider.query/2` with context-specific metadata including step name and correlation identifiers.
- Provider initializes Codex options via `Codex.Options.new/1`, applying defaults, environment overrides, and per-step configuration such as approval policies or sandbox parameters.
- Provider starts or resumes a thread using `Codex.start_thread/2` or `Codex.resume_thread/2` based on step configuration (e.g., `thread_id`, `resume` flags).
- Thread execution invokes `Codex.Thread.run/3`, optionally enabling streaming mode when live event handling is requested by the step configuration.
- Streaming events are collected, normalized, and optionally forwarded to pipeline streaming subsystem for real-time consumption.
- Provider aggregates final response, token usage, tool invocations, and structured outputs, returning normalized map to the step executor.
- Error paths capture CLI failures, approval rejection, timeout events, and malformed responses, translating them into structured error tuples consumed by pipeline control flow.
- Provider emits telemetry spans for CLI invocation, streaming phases, and finalization, enriching pipeline-level traces with provider-specific metadata.

## 11. Step Execution Semantics
- `Pipeline.Step.Codex` builds prompts using `Pipeline.PromptBuilder`, ensuring deterministic interpolation of prior step outputs and context variables.
- Step options map includes Codex configuration such as `model`, `approvals`, `sandbox_mode`, `attachments`, `structured_output`, `timeout_ms`, and `resume_thread` instructions.
- Step executor obtains provider via `Pipeline.TestMode.provider_for(:codex)` to respect mock/live selection based on environment.
- For streaming-enabled steps, the executor registers callbacks with `Pipeline.Streaming.ResultStream` to surface events to subscribers.
- After provider execution, executor updates `context.results` with response payload under step name, preserving both raw provider response and normalized fields (`text`, `success`, `cost`).
- Executor handles optional writing of outputs to files when `output_to_file` is provided, ensuring workspace paths align with pipeline configuration.
- Failure results propagate as `{"error": reason}` entries and trigger pipeline error handling, including checkpoint persistence and rollback hooks.
- Step metadata includes debug logging, duration metrics, and attachments required by subsequent steps.

## 12. Configuration and Environment Management
- Environment Variables: `CODEX_API_KEY`, `CODEX_PATH`, `CODEX_MODEL`, `CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY`, `CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS`, `CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE`, `CODEX_VERBOSE`.
- Application Config: `config :pipeline, codex: [model: "o1-mini", timeout_ms: 120_000, sandbox: :permissive, telemetry_prefix: [:pipeline, :codex]]`.
- Provider Config Retrieval: `Pipeline.Config.get_provider_config(:codex)` merges environment variables with application defaults, providing structured map consumed by provider module.
- CLI Path Resolution: Order of precedence is per README (options override, env var, system path). Validation ensures path exists and is executable before first invocation.
- Approval Policy Configuration: YAML workflow may reference named policies maintained in configuration, enabling consistent risk controls across pipelines.
- Telemetry Toggle: Environment flag `CODEX_OTLP_ENABLE` governs OpenTelemetry exporter activation, aligning with SDK capabilities.
- Workspace Directories: Step options allow overriding `cwd` or specifying attachments directories, inheriting defaults from pipeline context when omitted.
- Secrets Management: Encourage use of runtime secrets injection (e.g., `direnv`, `gcloud secrets`) with documentation reinforcing secure practices.

## 13. Data Contracts and Payload Schemas
- Provider Response Contract: `%{"text" => binary, "success" => boolean, "cost" => float, "metadata" => map}` with optional keys for `tokens`, `thread_id`, `function_calls`, `events`.
- Structured Output: When schema is supplied, provider includes `%{"structured_output" => map}` with JSON-decoded content for pipeline consumption.
- Event Payloads: Streaming events normalized into `%{type: atom, payload: map, timestamp: DateTime}` for consistent processing by downstream handlers.
- Approval Outcomes: `%{status: :approved | :denied | :pending, reason: binary, reviewer: binary}` enabling audit logging and decision analytics.
- Error Payload: `%{"success" => false, "error" => "%{code: atom, message: binary, retryable: boolean}"}` to inform retry logic and user feedback.
- CLI Diagnostic Metadata: `%{exit_status: integer, stdout: binary, stderr: binary, duration_ms: integer}` for troubleshooting CLI interactions.
- Telemetry Attributes: `%{provider: "codex", model: binary, sandbox_mode: atom, approval_policy: binary, workspace: binary}` aligned with OTLP conventions.
- File Attachment Descriptors: `%{path: binary, media_type: binary, size_bytes: integer, expiry: integer | :infinity}` to track staged artifacts.

## 14. Error Handling and Resiliency Strategies
- CLI Invocation Failures: Detect missing executable, invalid permissions, or non-zero exit codes; provide actionable error messages and fallback recommendations.
- Timeout Management: Support configurable timeouts with buffer to terminate hung CLI processes, leveraging `Task.shutdown/2` safeguards.
- Approval Denials: Respect approval hooks returning `{:deny, reason}` by aborting step and logging context for audit review.
- Network or Authentication Failures: Surface descriptive messages prompting re-authentication via CLI or API key provisioning.
- Retry Policy: Document guidelines for pipeline authors to wrap Codex steps with retry logic using existing pipeline features (e.g., `claude_robust` analog).
- Partial Responses: Handle scenarios where streaming events emit data but final completion fails; ensure pipeline receives coherent error state while retaining diagnostic context.
- Checkpoint Integration: Continue leveraging checkpoint manager to persist state prior to Codex steps, enabling resumption post-failure.
- Circuit Breakers: Consider future enhancement to disable Codex provider automatically after successive failures, falling back to alternate providers.

## 15. Observability, Telemetry, and Instrumentation
- Emit OpenTelemetry spans for provider invocation, CLI process management, streaming event processing, approval decisions, and response normalization.
