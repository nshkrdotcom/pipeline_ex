          Create a simple YAML pipeline configuration for a text processing task.
          
          The pipeline should:
          1. Have a descriptive name like "text_processor"
          2. Include one step that uses claude or gemini
          3. Have a prompt that processes or analyzes text input
          4. Be properly formatted YAML
          5. Be ready to execute with 'mix pipeline.run'
          
          Return only the complete YAML configuration, nothing else.
