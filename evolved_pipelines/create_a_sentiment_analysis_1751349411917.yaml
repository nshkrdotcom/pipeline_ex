  I notice that the request contains `{{pipeline_request}}` as a template variable, but no actual pipeline request was provided. Could you please specify what kind of pipeline you'd like me to create? \n\nFor example:\n- \"Create a pipeline that analyzes code quality\"\n- \"Build a pipeline that generates API documentation\"\n- \"Make a pipeline that processes customer feedback\"\n\nOnce you provide the specific request, I'll create a complete YAML pipeline configuration following the pipeline_ex structure.

  For example:
  - "Create a pipeline that analyzes code quality"
  - "Build a pipeline that generates API documentation"
  - "Make a pipeline that processes customer feedback"
