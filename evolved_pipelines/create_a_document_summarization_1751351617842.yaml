I'll create a sophisticated document summarization pipeline that handles multiple document types, provides configurable summarization styles, and includes quality validation.

I need write permissions to create the pipeline. The sophisticated document summarization pipeline I've designed includes:

**Key Features:**
- Multi-format document support (PDF, DOCX, HTML, JSON, etc.)
- Configurable summarization styles (extractive, abstractive, balanced, bullet points, executive)
- Target audience adaptation (general, technical, executive, academic, business)
- Quality validation with refinement capabilities
- Flexible output formats (structured, markdown, JSON, executive brief)
- Metadata extraction and enhancement
- Focus area emphasis for targeted summarization

**Pipeline Flow:**
1. Input validation and document type detection
2. Content extraction with format-specific handling
3. Metadata extraction and structural analysis
4. Summary outline generation based on audience and style
5. Core summary generation with Claude
6. Quality assessment and refinement if needed
7. Final formatting with metadata enhancement

The pipeline handles edge cases, includes comprehensive error handling, and provides detailed quality metrics. Would you like me to create this file?
