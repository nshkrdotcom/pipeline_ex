# Advanced Pipeline Features Guide

**üéØ Library Status: Complete Implementation Ready** - This guide covers the 5 critical advanced features that transform pipeline_ex from an 8.5/10 library into a complete 10/10 AI engineering platform.

## Overview

This document covers the advanced features implemented to address the critical gaps identified in the missing pieces analysis. These features enable intelligent, self-correcting workflows with enterprise-grade capabilities.

## üîÑ 1. Enhanced Loop Constructs

### For Loops
Execute steps iteratively over data collections with full variable scoping and error handling.

```yaml
- name: "process_files"
  type: "for_loop"
  iterator: "file"
  data_source: "previous_response:file_list"
  steps:
    - name: "analyze_file"
      type: "claude"
      prompt: "Analyze file: {{loop.file.name}}"
      
- name: "nested_processing"
  type: "for_loop"
  iterator: "category"
  data_source: "categories"
  parallel: true
  max_parallel: 3
  steps:
    - name: "process_category_files"
      type: "for_loop"
      iterator: "file"
      data_source: "{{loop.category.files}}"
      steps:
        - name: "analyze_file"
          type: "claude"
          prompt: "Analyze {{loop.file.path}} in {{loop.parent.category.name}}"
```

### While Loops
Continue execution until conditions are met with safety limits and early termination.

```yaml
- name: "fix_until_passing"
  type: "while_loop"
  condition: "test_results.status != 'passed'"
  max_iterations: 5
  steps:
    - name: "run_tests"
      type: "claude"
      prompt: "Run tests and analyze failures"
    - name: "fix_issues"
      type: "claude"
      prompt: "Fix the failing tests based on: {{previous_response}}"
```

### Loop Features
- **Variable Scoping**: `{{loop.variable}}` access with nested loop support (`{{loop.parent.variable}}`)
- **Parallel Execution**: Configure `parallel: true` with `max_parallel` limits
- **Safety Limits**: `max_iterations` prevents infinite loops
- **Error Handling**: `break_on_error` and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets

## üß† 2. Complex Conditional Logic

### Boolean Expressions
Advanced condition evaluation with AND/OR/NOT logic and comparison operators.

```yaml
- name: "conditional_step"
  type: "claude"
  condition:
    and:
      - "analysis.score > 7"
      - or:
        - "analysis.status == 'passed'"
        - "analysis.warnings.length < 3"
      - not: "analysis.errors.length > 0"
  prompt: "Proceed with implementation..."
```

### Comparison Operations
Support for mathematical and string comparison operations.

```yaml
- name: "complex_decision"
  type: "claude"
  condition:
    and:
      - "analysis.score * analysis.confidence > 0.8"
      - "any(analysis.issues, 'severity == \"high\"') == false"
      - "length(analysis.recommendations) between 3 and 10"
      - "analysis.timestamp > now() - days(7)"
      - "analysis.file_path matches '.*\\.ex$'"
```

### Switch/Case Branching
Route execution based on values with default fallbacks.

```yaml
- name: "route_by_status"
  type: "switch"
  expression: "analysis.status"
  cases:
    "passed": 
      - name: "deploy_step"
        type: "claude"
        prompt: "Deploy the application..."
    "failed":
      - name: "fix_step"
        type: "claude"
        prompt: "Fix the identified issues..."
    "warning":
      - name: "review_step"
        type: "claude"
        prompt: "Review warnings and decide..."
  default:
    - name: "unknown_status"
      type: "claude"
      prompt: "Handle unknown status..."
```

### Condition Features
- **Operators**: `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `contains`, `matches`, `between`

## üìö Migration Guide

### From Basic to Advanced
Existing pipelines remain fully compatible. To use advanced features:

1. **Add Loop Processing**:
   ```yaml
   # Before: Single step
   - name: "analyze"
     type: "claude"
     prompt: "Analyze file1.ex"
   
   # After: Loop over multiple files
   - name: "analyze_all"
     type: "for_loop"
     iterator: "file"
     data_source: "file_list"
     steps:
       - name: "analyze"
         type: "claude"
         prompt: "Analyze {{loop.file}}"
   ```

2. **Add Conditional Logic**:
   ```yaml
   # Before: Always runs
   - name: "deploy"
     type: "claude"
     prompt: "Deploy application"
   
   # After: Conditional execution
   - name: "deploy"
     type: "claude"
     condition: "tests.status == 'passed' and analysis.score > 8"
     prompt: "Deploy application"
   ```

3. **Add Schema Validation**:
   ```yaml
   # Before: Unstructured output
   - name: "analyze"
     type: "claude"
     prompt: "Analyze code"
   
   # After: Structured output
   - name: "analyze"
     type: "claude"
     output_schema:
       type: "object"
       required: ["score", "issues"]
     prompt: "Analyze code and return JSON"
   ```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Performance
- Use `parallel: true` for independent loop iterations
- Set appropriate `max_parallel` limits (typically 3-5)
- Use streaming for files >100MB
- Set memory limits for long-running processes

### Error Handling
- Always set `max_iterations` on while loops
- Use `break_on_error: false` for non-critical operations
- Implement fallback strategies with conditions
- Add checkpoints for long-running workflows

### Data Management
- Validate schemas early in pipelines
- Use data transformations to normalize between steps
- Keep state variables minimal and focused
- Clean up large temporary data regularly

### Codebase Intelligence
- Enable `codebase_context: true` for code analysis steps
- Cache codebase discovery results for multiple runs
- Use specific queries rather than broad scans
- Combine with file operations for intelligent refactoring
