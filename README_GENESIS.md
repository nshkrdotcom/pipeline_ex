# Genesis Pipeline - Self-Improving Pipeline Generator

## Overview

The Genesis Pipeline is the bootstrap mechanism for the META-PIPELINE system. It's a pipeline that generates other pipelines based on natural language requests, implementing the first step toward a self-evolving pipeline ecosystem.

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate a Pipeline

```bash
# Generate a simple pipeline (mock mode - safe, no API costs)
mix pipeline.generate "Create a pipeline that analyzes code quality"

# Generate with real AI providers (requires API keys)
mix pipeline.generate.live "Create a pipeline that analyzes code quality"

# Generate with specific performance profile
mix pipeline.generate "Process customer data" --profile speed_optimized

# Preview without creating files
mix pipeline.generate "Generate API documentation" --dry-run
```

### Mock vs Live Mode

- **Mock Mode** (default): Generates realistic pipelines without AI API calls - perfect for development and testing
- **Live Mode**: Uses real AI providers to generate pipelines - requires API keys but produces more sophisticated results

### 2. Run the Generated Pipeline

```bash
# Run the generated pipeline
mix pipeline.run generated_pipeline.yaml

# Run with input data
mix pipeline.run generated_pipeline.yaml --input data.json
```

## How It Works

1. **Request Analysis**: The Genesis Pipeline analyzes your natural language request to understand what kind of pipeline you need.

2. **DNA Generation**: It creates a "genetic blueprint" (DNA) that encodes the pipeline's characteristics, including:
   - Performance profile (speed vs accuracy)
   - Error handling strategy
   - Step sequences and dependencies
   - Provider preferences

3. **Pipeline Synthesis**: The DNA is transformed into a complete, executable pipeline YAML configuration.

4. **Validation**: The generated pipeline is validated for correctness and optimized based on the DNA traits.

5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is generated alongside the pipeline.

## Pipeline DNA Structure

Each generated pipeline has DNA that enables future evolution:

```elixir
%Pipeline.Meta.DNA{
  id: "unique-identifier",
  name: "pipeline_name",
  generation: 0,
  traits: [:performance_optimized, :error_resilient],
  chromosomes: %{
    structural: %{step_sequences: [...]},
    behavioral: %{error_handling: "retry_robust"},
    optimization: %{performance_profile: "balanced"}
  }
}
```

## Examples

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline

```bash
mix pipeline.generate "Process CSV files and extract insights" --profile accuracy_optimized
```

This generates a pipeline optimized for accuracy with steps for:
- Reading CSV data
- Data validation
- Analysis and insight extraction
- Report generation

### 2. Code Analysis Pipeline

```bash
mix pipeline.generate "Analyze codebase for security vulnerabilities" --complexity complex
```

Creates a complex pipeline with:
- Code scanning steps
- Vulnerability detection
- Risk assessment
- Remediation suggestions

### 3. Content Generation Pipeline

```bash
mix pipeline.generate "Generate blog posts from research papers"
```

Produces a pipeline that:
- Extracts key points from papers
- Transforms academic language
- Creates engaging blog content
- Adds appropriate formatting

## Advanced Features

### Pipeline Evolution (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Evolve an existing pipeline
mix pipeline.evolve generated_pipeline.yaml --generations 5

# Breed two successful pipelines
mix pipeline.breed pipeline1.yaml pipeline2.yaml
```

### Performance Profiles

- **speed_optimized**: Uses faster models, parallel execution
- **accuracy_optimized**: Uses most capable models, thorough analysis
- **balanced**: Optimal trade-off between speed and quality

### Error Handling Strategies

- **fail_fast**: Stop on first error
- **retry_robust**: Retry failed steps with exponential backoff
- **graceful_degradation**: Continue with defaults on failure

## Files Generated

When you run `mix pipeline.generate`, it creates:

1. **pipeline.yaml** - The executable pipeline configuration
2. **pipeline_README.md** - Documentation and usage instructions
3. **pipeline_dna.json** - Genetic information for future evolution

## Next Steps

1. **Test Your Pipeline**: Run the generated pipeline with sample data
2. **Customize**: Modify the generated YAML to fine-tune behavior
3. **Evolve**: Use the DNA to breed better pipelines
4. **Share**: Contribute successful pipelines back to the ecosystem

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Generation Fails

- Ensure your request is clear and specific
- Try adding more detail about inputs and outputs
- Use `--dry-run` to preview without file creation

### Generated Pipeline Doesn't Work

- Check the validation output for warnings
- Review the generated documentation
- Ensure required providers are configured

## Contributing

The Genesis Pipeline itself can be improved! It's designed to evolve:

1. Run Genesis on itself: `mix pipeline.generate "Improve the Genesis Pipeline"`
2. Test improvements carefully
3. Submit successful mutations back to the project

## Future Vision

The Genesis Pipeline is just the beginning. Future versions will:

- **Self-improve** through recursive enhancement
- **Learn** from successful pipelines
- **Breed** optimal solutions through genetic algorithms
- **Adapt** to new domains automatically
- **Discover** novel pipeline patterns
