# Workflow Optimization Strategies

## Core Problem: Making AI Automation Reliable

Your key insight is crucial: **"It's not about pipelines, it's about evals"**. The current system generates YAML and prays it works. We need systematic approaches to make AI assistance reliable and predictable.

## Immediate Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Prompt Engineering for Reliability**

#### Current Problem:
- Prompts are ad-hoc and inconsistent
- No systematic approach to prompt construction
- Context setup is inconsistent

#### Solution: Structured Prompt Templates
```yaml
# Template: elixir_analysis_prompt.yaml
prompt_template:
  name: elixir_code_analysis
  context_setup:
    - "You are an expert Elixir/OTP developer"
    - "Focus on functional programming principles"
    - "Consider supervision tree patterns"
    - "Avoid imperative patterns and sleep calls"
  
  task_definition:
    - "Analyze the provided Elixir code"
    - "Identify potential issues and improvements"
    - "Suggest OTP-compliant alternatives"
  
  output_format:
    - "Provide analysis in structured format"
    - "Include severity levels for issues"
    - "Suggest specific code improvements"
  
  validation_criteria:
    - "Check for OTP compliance"
    - "Verify functional programming principles"
    - "Ensure no anti-patterns"
```

### 2. **Multi-Step Validation Pipeline**

#### The TLC Problem:
You need "TLC agents" - automated reviewers that catch Claude's mistakes.

#### Solution: Validation Chain
```yaml
# validation_pipeline.yaml
workflow:
  name: reliable_code_analysis
  steps:
    - name: initial_analysis
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Analyze this Elixir code for issues"
      
    - name: validate_analysis
      type: claude_robust
      prompt: |
        Review the previous analysis for accuracy:
        - Are identified issues actually problems?
        - Are suggestions OTP-compliant?
        - Are there missed issues?
        
    - name: cross_validate
      type: gemini
      prompt: "Independently analyze the same code and compare findings"
      
    - name: synthesize_final
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Combine all analyses into final, validated report"
```

### 3. **Context-Fresh Prompt Strategy**

#### Your Insight:
"Clean prompts that are small and testable with all new required reading for context"

#### Optimization Pattern:
```yaml
# context_fresh_template.yaml
workflow:
  name: context_fresh_analysis
  steps:
    - name: setup_context
      type: file_ops
      operation: read_context_files
      files:
        - "relevant_modules.ex"
        - "test_examples.exs"
        - "otp_patterns.md"
        
    - name: focused_analysis
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: |
        Context: {{context_files}}
        
        Task: Analyze only this specific function
        Code: {{target_code}}
        
        Constraints:
        - Focus only on this function
        - Use provided context only
        - No external assumptions
        
    - name: validate_against_context
      type: claude_robust
      prompt: "Verify analysis uses only provided context"
```

## Sequential Pipeline Optimization

### Your Requirement:
"Sequential pipelines that run nice and slow and steady, each pipeline finishes to 100% completion"

### Optimization Strategy: Pipeline Stages

#### Stage 1: Comprehensive Analysis
```yaml
analysis_stage:
  steps:
    - name: understand_requirement
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Thoroughly understand what needs to be done"
      validation: "Requirement clarity check"
      
    - name: identify_dependencies
      type: claude_extract
      prompt: "Identify all dependencies and constraints"
      validation: "Dependency completeness check"
      
    - name: plan_approach
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Create detailed implementation plan"
      validation: "Plan feasibility check"
```

#### Stage 2: Implementation with Validation
```yaml
implementation_stage:
  steps:
    - name: implement_solution
      type: claude_robust
      prompt: "Implement following the validated plan"
      validation: "Code syntax and logic check"
      
    - name: test_implementation
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Generate comprehensive tests"
      validation: "Test coverage verification"
      
    - name: verify_requirements
      type: claude_robust
      prompt: "Verify all requirements are met"
      validation: "Requirements compliance check"
```

#### Stage 3: Quality Assurance
```yaml
qa_stage:
  steps:
    - name: code_review
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Perform thorough code review"
      validation: "Review quality check"
      
    - name: performance_analysis
      type: claude_extract
      prompt: "Analyze performance implications"
      validation: "Performance metrics validation"
      
    - name: final_validation
      type: claude_robust
      prompt: "Final validation of complete solution"
      validation: "Completion criteria check"
```

## Critical Thinking Integration

### Problem: Lack of Critical Thinking
Current system doesn't apply critical thinking to improve the process.

### Solution: Reflective Pipelines
```yaml
# reflective_pipeline.yaml
workflow:
  name: critical_thinking_pipeline
  steps:
    - name: initial_solution
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Provide initial solution"
      
    - name: critique_solution
      type: claude_robust
      prompt: |
        Critically analyze the previous solution:
        - What could go wrong?
        - What edge cases are missed?
        - Are there better approaches?
        
    - name: improve_solution
      type: claude_smart
      prompt: "Improve solution based on critique"
      
    - name: validate_improvement
      type: claude_robust
      prompt: "Verify improvements address critiques"
```

## Addressing "Claude Doing Dumb Shit"

### Common Claude Mistakes in Elixir:
1. Using `sleep` calls instead of proper OTP patterns
2. Imperative patterns instead of functional approaches
3. Poor error handling strategies
4. Ignoring supervision tree patterns

### Optimization: Error-Aware Prompts
```yaml
# elixir_optimized_prompt.yaml
prompt_template:
  name: elixir_safe_coding
  anti_patterns_to_avoid:
    - "Never use Process.sleep for timing"
    - "Avoid imperative loops, use Enum functions"
    - "Don't ignore supervision tree patterns"
    - "Always handle errors with proper patterns"
  
  required_patterns:
    - "Use GenServer for stateful processes"
    - "Implement proper supervision strategies"
    - "Use pattern matching for control flow"
    - "Follow OTP principles consistently"
  
  validation_checks:
    - "Check for OTP compliance"
    - "Verify error handling patterns"
    - "Ensure functional programming approach"
    - "Validate supervision tree design"
```

## Practical Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (This Week)
1. **Create Prompt Templates**: Build 5-10 proven prompt templates
2. **Add Validation Steps**: Every pipeline needs validation
3. **Test Small Workflows**: Start with documentation and analysis

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (Next 2 Weeks)

2. **Critical Thinking**: Add reflective analysis steps
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track success rates and improve

## Key Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics:
- **Validation Success Rate**: % of validations that pass
- **Error Recovery Rate**: % of errors successfully recovered
- **Context Compliance**: % of responses using only provided context

### Productivity Metrics:
- **Manual Review Time**: Reduction in human review time
- **Task Completion Rate**: % of tasks completed without human intervention
- **Prompt Reusability**: Number of times prompts are successfully reused

## Bottom Line Optimization Strategy

**Focus on reliability over features:**

1. **Small, Testable Prompts**: Build library of proven prompt patterns
2. **Multi-Step Validation**: Never trust single AI responses
3. **Context Control**: Strict context management for predictable results
4. **Error Awareness**: Design prompts to avoid known failure modes
5. **Human Checkpoints**: Strategic human validation points

This approach addresses your core insight: the problem isn't automation, it's reliability. By building systematic validation and error recovery into every pipeline, you can achieve the "TLC" you need while maintaining the benefits of AI assistance.
