## Key Insights

1. **It's about evals, not pipelines** - The core issue is lack of systematic evaluation and improvement
2. **Use for preparation, not automation** - Best for research and analysis, not final decisions
3. **Build validation into everything** - Never trust single AI responses
4. **Start small and build evidence** - Focus on low-risk, high-value tasks first

## Recommended Reading Order
