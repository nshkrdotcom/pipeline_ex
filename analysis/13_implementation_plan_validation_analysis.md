## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. **Python Integration Complexity**

**Problem**: The original analysis highlighted that Python integration would be complex, but our current plans underestimate this complexity.

**Specific Gaps**:
- **Data serialization**: No plan for efficient Elixir ↔ Python data exchange
- **Process management**: No strategy for managing Python process lifecycle
- **Error propagation**: No system for handling Python errors in Elixir context
- **Performance optimization**: No caching strategy for Python calls

**Impact**: High - Could significantly delay DSPy integration

### 2. **Real-Time Optimization Constraints**

**Problem**: Original analysis emphasized optimization might introduce latency, but our plans don't address real-time constraints.

**Specific Gaps**:
- **Async optimization**: No plan for background optimization
- **Threshold management**: No strategy for deciding when to optimize
- **Cache invalidation**: No system for managing optimization cache lifecycle
- **Fallback timing**: No timeouts for optimization attempts

**Impact**: Medium - Could affect production performance

### 3. **Training Data Pipeline Architecture**

**Problem**: Original analysis required systematic training data management, but our plans lack architectural details.

**Specific Gaps**:
- **Data versioning**: No plan for training data version control
- **Quality metrics**: No framework for measuring training data quality
- **Bias detection**: No system for identifying training data bias
- **Privacy compliance**: No consideration of data privacy requirements

**Impact**: Medium - Could limit optimization effectiveness

### 4. **Production Deployment Strategy**

**Problem**: Original analysis emphasized production readiness, but our plans lack deployment specifics.

**Specific Gaps**:
- **Gradual rollout**: No plan for phased DSPy feature deployment
- **A/B testing**: No framework for comparing DSPy vs traditional execution
- **Monitoring integration**: No specific metrics for DSPy performance
- **Rollback mechanisms**: No strategy for reverting DSPy optimizations

**Impact**: High - Could prevent production adoption

## Infrastructure Prompt Validation

### ✅ **Well-Aligned Infrastructure Prompts**
