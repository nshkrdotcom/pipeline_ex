# Documentation Links Fixed

## Summary

Fixed broken documentation links in the pipeline_ex project by commenting out references to planned but not yet implemented documentation files.

## Fixed Issues

### In CLAUDE.md

#### Missing Specification Documents
The following specification documents were referenced but don't exist yet:
- `docs/specifications/analysis_pipelines.md`
- `docs/specifications/content_generation_pipelines.md`
- `docs/specifications/devops_pipelines.md`

**Action taken**: Commented out these references with HTML comments indicating they are planned but not yet implemented.

#### Missing Architecture Documents
The following architecture documents were referenced but don't exist yet:
- `docs/architecture/system_design.md`
- `docs/architecture/pipeline_patterns.md`
- `docs/architecture/scalability.md`
- `docs/architecture/security.md`

**Action taken**: Commented out these references with HTML comments indicating they are planned but not yet implemented.

#### Missing Guide Documents
The following guide documents were referenced but don't exist yet:
- `docs/guides/pipeline_authoring.md`
- `docs/guides/prompt_engineering.md`
- `docs/guides/testing_pipelines.md`
- `docs/guides/optimization.md`

**Action taken**: Commented out these references with HTML comments indicating they are planned but not yet implemented.

#### Missing API Documentation Directory
The entire `docs/api/` directory doesn't exist, so all API documentation references were broken:
- `docs/api/step_types.md`
- `docs/api/providers.md`
- `docs/api/functions.md`
- `docs/api/templates.md`

**Action taken**: Commented out the entire API References section with HTML comments indicating it is planned but not yet implemented.

## Verified Working Links

### All Other Documentation Links Are Valid
- All links in README.md are valid and working
- All links in RECURSIVE_PIPELINES_GUIDE.md are valid and working
- All links in docs/20250704_yaml_format_v2/index.md are valid and working
- All existing specification documents are properly linked
- All existing architecture documents are properly linked
- All existing guide documents are properly linked

## Recommendations

1. The commented-out documentation represents a significant amount of planned documentation that should be created as the project evolves.

2. Consider creating stub files for the missing documentation with basic outlines to avoid broken links while indicating the documentation is in progress.

3. Alternatively, remove the commented sections entirely until the documentation is ready to be written.

4. Set up a documentation validation script that checks for broken links as part of the CI/CD pipeline to prevent this issue in the future.
