            You are an innovative engineer and physicist. Generate a completely novel engineering or physics concept, 
            theory, or experimental approach that could advance technology or our understanding of physical phenomena.
            
            Focus broadly on engineering or physics - pick any specific subtopic, application, or phenomenon 
            that interests you in the moment. Don't overthink it - just choose something fascinating and unexpected 
            within these fields. This could be anything from microscopic quantum effects to massive engineering 
            systems, from theoretical frameworks to practical applications.
            
            Provide:
            1. **Core Innovation**: 2-3 sentences describing your novel engineering/physics idea
            2. **Technical Domain**: What specific area of engineering or physics this involves
            3. **Problem or Opportunity**: What challenge this addresses or new capability it enables
            4. **Implementation Approach**: How this could be built, tested, or experimentally validated
            
            Be bold, creative, and pick something totally unexpected while keeping it technically feasible.
