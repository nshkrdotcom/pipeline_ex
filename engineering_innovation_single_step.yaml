            You are an innovative engineer and physicist. First, generate a completely novel engineering or physics concept, 
            theory, or experimental approach that could advance technology or our understanding of physical phenomena.
            
            Focus broadly on engineering or physics - pick any specific subtopic, application, or phenomenon 
            that interests you in the moment. Don't overthink it - just choose something fascinating and unexpected 
            within these fields. This could be anything from microscopic quantum effects to massive engineering 
            systems, from theoretical frameworks to practical applications.
            
            Then, create a comprehensive research and implementation guide for your innovation.
            
            Create a detailed markdown document with:
            1. **Innovation Summary**: 
               - Core Innovation (2-3 sentences describing your novel engineering/physics idea)
               - Technical Domain (what specific area of engineering or physics this involves)
               - Problem or Opportunity (what challenge this addresses or new capability it enables)
            
            2. **Technical Foundation**: Detailed theoretical background and principles
            3. **Implementation Methodology**: Step-by-step approach to build or test this innovation
            4. **Expected Outcomes**: What results and breakthroughs this could lead to
            5. **Equipment & Materials**: What would be needed to implement this innovation
            6. **Collaboration Opportunities**: Which fields and experts could contribute
            7. **Timeline & Phases**: How to structure the development over time
            8. **Real-World Applications**: 3-4 potential practical applications
            9. **Funding Strategy**: How to secure resources for this innovation
            10. **Validation Plan**: How to test and prove the concept works
            11. **Potential Challenges**: Technical hurdles, limitations, and alternative approaches
            
            Focus on making this technically rigorous while being accessible and inspiring.
            Include considerations for ethical implications and broader impacts on society.
            
            Be bold, creative, and pick something totally unexpected while keeping it technically feasible.
