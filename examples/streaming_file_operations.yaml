            Please perform these file operations in order:
            1. Create a file called test_file.txt with the content "Hello from streaming!"
            2. Read the file to confirm it was created
            3. Append a new line "This is line 2" to the file
            4. Delete the file using rm command
            
            Perform each operation separately so we can see the streaming.
