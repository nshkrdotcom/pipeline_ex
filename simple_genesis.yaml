          Create a simple YAML pipeline configuration for the following request: {{pipeline_request}}
          
          The pipeline should have:
          1. A descriptive name based on the request
          2. At least one step that uses claude or gemini
          3. A simple prompt for that step
          4. Proper YAML structure
          
          Return only the YAML configuration, no other text.
