# JULY_1_ARCH_DOCS_06: Implementation Roadmap & Milestones

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for transforming pipeline_ex into the full ElexirionDSP platform. The roadmap is designed for incremental delivery, allowing us to validate each component before building the next layer.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What We Have (Foundation Complete)
- **Pipeline Execution Engine**: Robust OTP-based pipeline executor
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Claude and Gemini integration working
- **Genesis Pipeline**: Dynamic pipeline generation from requests
- **Emergent Fallbacks**: System recovers gracefully from AI failures
- **Pipeline DNA**: Evolution tracking and genealogy
- **Basic Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers and retry logic

### ⚠️ What's Partially Built
- **Provider Options**: Tool restrictions (fixed in this session)
- **Structured Output**: `claude_extract` needs enhancement
- **Parallel Execution**: Framework exists, needs optimization
- **Telemetry**: Basic events, needs comprehensive metrics

### ❌ What's Missing (Build Next)
- **Agent Framework**: No conversational interface
- **DSPy Integration**: No prompt optimization
- **Web API**: No HTTP interface
- **Continuous Learning**: No feedback loop
- **Production Deployment**: No scalability features

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Agent Framework (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Transform from CLI tool to conversational AI assistant

#### Week 1: Core Agent Implementation
- [ ] **Day 1-2**: `PipelineAgent.handle_request/1` basic implementation
  ```elixir
  # Milestone: Single agent can route requests to pipelines
  PipelineAgent.handle_request("analyze this code") 
  # -> Routes to analysis pipeline automatically
  ```

- [ ] **Day 3-4**: Agent routing and classification system
  ```elixir
  # Milestone: Request classification working
  Agent.Router.classify_request("refactor my module") 
  # -> Returns: %{type: :refactoring, confidence: 0.9, agent: RefactoringAgent}
  ```

- [ ] **Day 5-7**: Session management and context preservation
  ```elixir
  # Milestone: Agents remember conversation context
  session = Agent.start_session()
  Agent.chat(session, "analyze my code")
  Agent.chat(session, "now refactor it based on that analysis")
  # -> Second request has context from first
  ```

#### Week 2: Interface Implementation
- [ ] **Day 8-10**: Phoenix web API endpoints
  ```bash
  # Milestone: HTTP API working
  curl -X POST /api/agent/chat \
    -d '{"message": "analyze my codebase"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```

- [ ] **Day 11-12**: Basic web chat interface
  ```javascript
  // Milestone: Browser chat working
  agent.sendMessage("Help me refactor this module")
  // -> Returns formatted response with actions
  ```

- [ ] **Day 13-14**: CLI agent commands
  ```bash
  # Milestone: Conversational CLI working
  mix agent.chat
  # -> Interactive chat session starts

    quality_score: 8.5
  })
  ```

#### Week 4: Optimization Loop
- [ ] **Day 22-23**: Evaluation metrics implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk: DSPy-Elixir Integration Complexity
**Mitigation**: Start with simple subprocess calls, evolve to more sophisticated communication

**Fallback Plan**: If DSPy integration fails, implement basic prompt A/B testing in Elixir

#### Risk: Performance at Scale
**Mitigation**: Build performance testing from Day 1, optimize incrementally

**Fallback Plan**: Implement horizontal scaling with multiple Elixir nodes

#### Risk: AI Provider Rate Limits
**Mitigation**: Implement sophisticated rate limiting and provider rotation

**Fallback Plan**: Cache common responses, implement offline modes

### Timeline Risks

#### Risk: Ambitious 8-Week Timeline
**Mitigation**: Prioritize core features, defer advanced capabilities if needed

**Fallback Plan**: Deliver core agent framework (Phase 1-2) first, iterate on advanced features

#### Risk: Complexity Underestimation
**Mitigation**: Build MVPs first, add complexity incrementally

**Fallback Plan**: Reduce scope but ensure each delivered component is production-quality

## Success Metrics
